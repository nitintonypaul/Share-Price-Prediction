# Share Price Prediction Model

<br>
A simple python program designed to predict oncoming share prices using fundamental machine learning topics. The program predicts data using the sequential model and plots a graph with the predicted values and actual values as a test-run, before predicting the oncoming share price of a given company.<br><br>
